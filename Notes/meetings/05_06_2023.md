## Meeting with client 05.06.2023:
1. The difference between mark as damaged and defective buttons in item is:
    `only the Log is different`

2. Client role can print their invoice.
3. FE: Create select component removes its value on click outside the component. Check if it can be modified

4. Logs:
   
    - [Investigate] logs seem to be missing:
      - Update item count
      - Add item to shopping list
   New log needed: Lowering item count.
    - Branch off update item log:
      - Item log: Save differences before and after aciton.

      >Angel'sRandomOpinion: Did an unknown action is kinda useless as a log msg ngl

Todos:
---
- [ ] Add print action to item
- [ ] Printing ticket goes out of bounds very easily
- [ ] Search does not have clear
- [ ] Add error boundary to pages

- [ ] Item page : On filtration by category, display table headers of the category as well

- [ ] Shopping list: Add action  `Receive 1` or `Receive many`. Remove Reason & status ( leftover old logic )

Errors
---
On Item creation, frontend probably did not send a Brand
``` 
Servlet.service() for servlet [dispatcherServlet] in context with path [] threw exception [Request processing failed: java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke "com.nakamas.hatfieldbackend.models.entities.ticket.Brand.getModels()" because "brand" is null] with root cause

java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke "com.nakamas.hatfieldbackend.models.entities.ticket.Brand.getModels()" because "brand" is null
(InventoryItemService.java:50)
```


FE: While on page 2, if you search, it stays on page 2. It should reset the pagination on search update.
